Rather than implementing a Bio-Formats writer, I encourage you to check out
SCIFIO [1, 2, 3]. Though still in beta, SCIFIO is the core I/O mechanism of
ImageJ2, which is finally due for release later this week. SCIFIO uses the
SciJava plugin framework, meaning your writer would be automatically
discovered and used as appropriate with no additional work from you. And we
have recently integrated SCIFIO directly into ImageJ at the core level, so
things like File > Open now use it, including whatever format plugins are
available. (SCIFIO also has a Bio-Formats format plugin, so that all of the
BF formats work in ImageJ that way, too!)

You could then serve your Imaris writer from its own ImageJ update site [4,
5], to make it available to all ImageJ users.

Glad to hear that Bitplane is willing to do this. In that case, if you do
complete a SCIFIO Imaris writer and want to donate the code upstream, you
could file a pull request against the SCIFIO LifeSci project [6] to
contribute it there, since that project houses readers & writers for _open_
life sciences formats. So if Bitplane publishes an open specification, we
would be willing to add it to the project.

If you have any questions about SCIFIO, please feel free to use the SCIFIO
mailing list [7]. Or if you go the Bio-Formats route, you can use ome-devel
[8].

Curtis

Hi Kedar,

 Just wanted to let you know that I'll be out of the country for two weeks
starting tomorrow, and all of my time right now is being spent on the ImageJ2
release
<http://developer.imagej.net/2014/06/04/imagej-200-release-candidate>.

 Would you mind filing this as an issue on the scifio-itk-bridge github
site: https://github.com/scifio/scifio-itk-bridge ? That way it won't get
lost in my e-mail and I can investigate when I get back.

Thanks!

Hi Kedar,

> were scrambled and once when it worked.

When you have file-format-specific problems like this, it is very important
to understand at what layer the problem is occurring. Please test with
Bio-Formats 5.0.2 -- e.g., with the command line tools, or in an up-to-date
version of Fiji -- and verify whether you see the same faulty behavior.
Then test with an older version of Bio-Formats [1], too. If the problem
occurs with 5.0.2 on its own, that rules out the SCIFIO-ITK bridge layer as
the culprit, meaning the bug should be reported to the ome-users list [2]
so that the Bio-Formats developers can address it.

Or if the problem truly is with the ITK bridge, then Mark is the best
person to investigate, when he returns from vacation.

Curtis

Hi Curtis,

This all sounds great. I've cloned the SCIFIO core as well as the
tutorials, which have been quite helpful in getting things set up.

I've created a class in the io.scif.formats package for my writer. Since I
only have the writer components, but not the reader, how should I go about
implementing all of the component classes of Format (Metadata, Parser,
Checker, Reader, Writer, Translator). The first 4 are listed as mandatory
in the tutorial, but it seems like I shouldn't need all of them for writing
functionality alone.

Best,
Henry

Since I only have the writer components, but not the reader, how should I go about implementing all of the component classes of Format (Metadata, Parser, Checker, Reader, Writer, Translator). The first 4 are listed as mandatory in the tutorial, but it seems like I shouldn&#39;t need all of them for writing functionality alone.

In that case, if you do complete a SCIFIO Imaris writer and want to donate the code upstream, you could file a pull request against the SCIFIO LifeSci project [6] to contribute it there, since that project houses readers & writers for _open_ life sciences formats.

Dear all,

Do you know when it would be possible to open in ImageJ .lif files acquired with the new version of LAS AF (4.0)? (So when Bio-Formats will be updated with LAS AF 4?)
Many thanks for your help.

Kind regards,
Camille Godon.

This is a question to direct to the OME-users mailing list, which is the
best place to ask Bio-Formats questions.
http://lists.openmicroscopy.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/ome-users

Have you been in contact with the Bio-Formats team previously with an LAS
AF 4 specification document, and/or any sample non-working files? The team
will need them in order to improve the LIF reader. You can upload sample
data using the OME QA system: http://qa.openmicroscopy.org.uk/qa/upload/

Once you report the issue to the OME team, a ticket will created in the OME
issue tracker so that you can follow the status of the new feature.

Regards,
Curtis

Rather than implementing a Bio-Formats writer, I encourage you to check out
SCIFIO [1, 2, 3]. Though still in beta, SCIFIO is the core I/O mechanism of
ImageJ2, which is finally due for release later this week. SCIFIO uses the
SciJava plugin framework, meaning your writer would be automatically
discovered and used as appropriate with no additional work from you. And we
have recently integrated SCIFIO directly into ImageJ at the core level, so
things like File > Open now use it, including whatever format plugins are
available. (SCIFIO also has a Bio-Formats format plugin, so that all of the
BF formats work in ImageJ that way, too!)

You could then serve your Imaris writer from its own ImageJ update site [4,
5], to make it available to all ImageJ users.

Glad to hear that Bitplane is willing to do this. In that case, if you do
complete a SCIFIO Imaris writer and want to donate the code upstream, you
could file a pull request against the SCIFIO LifeSci project [6] to
contribute it there, since that project houses readers & writers for _open_
life sciences formats. So if Bitplane publishes an open specification, we
would be willing to add it to the project.

If you have any questions about SCIFIO, please feel free to use the SCIFIO
mailing list [7]. Or if you go the Bio-Formats route, you can use ome-devel
[8].

Curtis

Hi Kedar,

 Just wanted to let you know that I'll be out of the country for two weeks
starting tomorrow, and all of my time right now is being spent on the ImageJ2
release
<http://developer.imagej.net/2014/06/04/imagej-200-release-candidate>.

 Would you mind filing this as an issue on the scifio-itk-bridge github

lost in my e-mail and I can investigate when I get back.

Hi Kedar,

When you have file-format-specific problems like this, it is very important
to understand at what layer the problem is occurring. Please test with
Bio-Formats 5.0.2 -- e.g., with the command line tools, or in an up-to-date
version of Fiji -- and verify whether you see the same faulty behavior.
Then test with an older version of Bio-Formats [1], too. If the problem
occurs with 5.0.2 on its own, that rules out the SCIFIO-ITK bridge layer as
the culprit, meaning the bug should be reported to the ome-users list [2]
so that the Bio-Formats developers can address it.

Or if the problem truly is with the ITK bridge, then Mark is the best
person to investigate, when he returns from vacation.

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Curtis,

I have wrapped the Bioformats tools and am using it for now. I'll let you
know and e-mail the ome-users list if the problem recurs.

Thanks,

Hi Curtis,

This all sounds great. I've cloned the SCIFIO core as well as the
tutorials, which have been quite helpful in getting things set up.

I've created a class in the io.scif.formats package for my writer. Since I
only have the writer components, but not the reader, how should I go about
implementing all of the component classes of Format (Metadata, Parser,
Checker, Reader, Writer, Translator). The first 4 are listed as mandatory
in the tutorial, but it seems like I shouldn't need all of them for writing
functionality alone.

Best,
Henry

Many thanks for your help.

This is a question to direct to the OME-users mailing list, which is the
best place to ask Bio-Formats questions.
http://lists.openmicroscopy.org.uk/mailman/listinfo/ome-users

Have you been in contact with the Bio-Formats team previously with an LAS
AF 4 specification document, and/or any sample non-working files? The team
will need them in order to improve the LIF reader. You can upload sample
data using the OME QA system: http://qa.openmicroscopy.org.uk/qa/upload/

Once you report the issue to the OME team, a ticket will created in the OME
issue tracker so that you can follow the status of the new feature.

Regards,
Curtis
