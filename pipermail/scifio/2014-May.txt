Hi Ajeet,

For others' reference: https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/159

Ajeet: SCIFIO has a low-level TIFF API you can use to do it:
https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/master/scifio/src/main/java/io/scif/formats/tiff/TiffParser.java
https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/master/scifio/src/main/java/io/scif/formats/tiff/IFD.java

See in particular IFD#getImageWidth() and IFD#getImageHeight().

Better would be to fix the bug in SCIFIO's TiffFormat, such that it reports
a different Image per plane size. Want to try your hand at it? Mark and I
would be happy to answer any technical questions.
