Subject: [SCIFIO] SCIFIO 0.7.4 Released today
Message-ID: <CA+B=mGo3zhY4YdVyfa6AnRuXViZVca4u5axX1QJBSXK+qtxBVg@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

 Today I released SCIFIO 0.7.4 - it can be downloaded directly from
GitHub<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/releases>,
and is part of pom-scijava
1.111<https://github.com/scijava/scijava-common/commit/4cb7d8d92810b173f18fadcc25e1567b9b3d2e1a>.
Side note: pom-scijava 1.111 also fixes a gav bug with scifio-lifesci, so
this version is now being tracked correctly (e.g. if you want to use the
updated SDTFormat<https://github.com/scifio/scifio-lifesci/blob/master/src/main/java/io/scif/lifesci/SDTFormat.java>
).

In addition to bug fixes and general improvements, I wanted to highlight a
few new features:

* Tools <https://github.com/scifio/scifio/tree/master/tools>! The
Bio-Formats command line tools have been ported to SCIFIO. In keeping with
SCIFIO theme, these tools now support dynamic command extension - via the
SCIFIOToolCommand<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/master/tools/src/main/java/io/scif/tools/SCIFIOToolCommand.java>plugins.
Also, a lot of boilerplate is taken care of now in the abstract
layer, e.g. using args4j <http://args4j.kohsuke.org/> to print command
usage. I tried to adhere to Git syntax for using these tools, so I think it
feels pretty slick.

  I only ported show, info and convert for now. If you try implementing a
new command and have any questions or problems please e-mail me/the list!

  You can also download the latest
tools<http://jenkins.imagej.net/view/SCIFIO/job/SCIFIO/>from jenkins,
in
zip<http://jenkins.imagej.net/view/SCIFIO/job/SCIFIO/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/tools/target/scifio-tools-0.7.5-SNAPSHOT-scripts.zip>and
bz2<http://jenkins.imagej.net/view/SCIFIO/job/SCIFIO/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/tools/target/scifio-tools-0.7.5-SNAPSHOT-scripts.tar.bz2>flavors.

* New package: refs<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/commit/d8cad77b212d6faf7bf49471f5a3ffaf46c75c7d>.
This adds a RefManagerService<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/master/scifio/src/main/java/io/scif/refs/RefManagerService.java>which
works in unison with the new
RefProvider<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/master/scifio/src/main/java/io/scif/refs/RefProvider.java>plugin
type to manage references and perform cleanup operations  after they
are enqueued in a ReferenceQueue.

* Redesigned cache
functionality<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/commit/781ab8ef00845b6759d27ea2a9a60767505eeb5d>.
This is the result of our latest hackathon with Christian Dietz. A lot
happened here, so you can look at the related
issue<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/69>and commit message
for the complete story. But to summarize, cache
performance was terrible and used some ill-advised Java practices. Now
(thanks to the RefManagerService, among other things) we're doing things
properly and performance is obscenely improved.

Thanks for reading this update. If you have any questions/comments, please
let me know.

- Mark

Thanks Christian! Looks like I had leftover code from the Bio-Formats
TIFFReader, so I was populating physical pixel size fields, but not
transferring that data to the actual axes.

Works for me now.. running the Info command prints correct calibration
values. Let me know if you have any more problems.

thanks, Mark
