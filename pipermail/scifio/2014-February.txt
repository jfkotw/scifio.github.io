Hi Brian,

I'm also working on incorporating this into the Bio-Formats writer, so if

This is fantastic. I am selfishly quite excited for someone else to create
a new SCIFIO format. :)

To get you (and other developers) started, I put together a wiki
page<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/wiki/Adding-support-for-an-image-format>that
discusses various aspects of format implementation, and provides a
number of links to resources & tutorials for both Bio-Formats and SCIFIO.

The referenced tutorials are intended to take you through the format
implementation process, but if you have any questions or run into problems,
please feel welcome to reach out to the SCIFIO (scifio at scif.io) or
Bio-Formats (ome-devel at lists.openmicroscopy.org.uk) mailing lists.

Let me know if anything is unclear on the wiki page.

Thanks, we look forward to your contribution!
- Mark
