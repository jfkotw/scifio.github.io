(Resending this now that I have joined the mailing list)

T1dSavingImagePlanes saves a fake image ?8bit-signed&pixelType=int8&lengths=50,50,3,5,7&axes=X,Y,Z,Channel,Time.fake? as a png file.

I run the program and it completes without errors.

I?m curious though because I didn?t think PNG files could handle anything other than 2D images. So I try to open the SCIFIOTutorial.png
in ImageJ and I see only a single plane image. There are no warnings or errors when saving the file to suggest that there is any loss of fidelity. Is
that the intention?

Anyway, I know TIFF files can support multiple channels, so I change SCIFIOTutorial.png to SCIFIOTutorial.tif and run the program. I get the following exception:

Exception in thread "main" io.scif.FormatException: Buffer too small (got 2500, expected 12500).
	at io.scif.util.FormatTools.checkBufferSize(FormatTools.java:665)
	at io.scif.util.FormatTools.checkPlaneForWriting(FormatTools.java:610)
	at io.scif.AbstractWriter.checkParams(AbstractWriter.java:121)
	at io.scif.formats.TIFFFormat$Writer.savePlane(TIFFFormat.java:1291)
	at io.scif.formats.TIFFFormat$Writer.writePlane(TIFFFormat.java:1399)

	at io.scif.AbstractWriter.savePlane(AbstractWriter.java:159)
	at io.scif.tutorials.core.T1dSavingImagePlanes.main(T1dSavingImagePlanes.java:75)

Now this is most unexpected, because I would have assumed the TIFF format was able to store the images with at least the same fidelity as PNG.

OK I know TIFF can save files of 3 dimensions, so I change the fake images to ?8bit-signed&pixelType=int8&lengths=50,50,7&axes=X,Y,Channel.fake?

Again I get and exception.

OK, how about a 2D image, ?8bit-signed&pixelType=int8&lengths=50,50&axes=X,Y.fake??

And that finally works.

So how do I save a X,Y,Channels image in TIFF format with SCIFIO?

Thanks for any help.

Hi Michael,

SCIFIO writes the APNG format [1] when there are multiple planes.

Standard PNG readers (including ImageJ 1.x's built-in PNG reader) will read
only the first plane. Did you try with File > Import > Image... which uses
SCIFIO when opening?

Thanks for the report. I can confirm this bug. I filed an issue for it:
    https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/236

> So how do I save a X,Y,Channels image in TIFF format with SCIFIO?

Once that issue is resolved, things should work!

Curtis, many thanks.

Whilst I?m on the subject of TIFF I experimented with using the TIFF specific reader/parser.

Our TIFF files use the PAGE_NAME TIFF TIFF tag to give a name to each of the channel names. Is this information accessible through the SCIFIO?

Many thanks ? Michael Ellis

Hi Stephan!

>a CellImg that is paged and can be read and written. Is this project
already finished, does this work already?

It is done! The SCIFIOCellImg
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/dc06e67c8a60ac3e93784722a3dc64d534f24834/src/main/java/io/scif/img/cell/SCIFIOCellImg.java>was
added a few hackathons ago with the guidance of Tobias. There are
heuristics to use it automatically as needed by the ImgOpener
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/dc06e67c8a60ac3e93784722a3dc64d534f24834/src/main/java/io/scif/img/ImgOpener.java>,
and you can also configure it
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/dc06e67c8a60ac3e93784722a3dc64d534f24834/src/main/java/io/scif/config/SCIFIOConfig.java#L364>
to be used by default.

If you're interested, there are tickets open to evaluate performance
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/201>, and supporting large planes
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/125> via SCIFIOCellImg is a goal
of mine for the next hackathon.

>Thanks so much and have a great day,

You too! Let me know if you have any questions/problems.

Best,
Mark

Message-ID: <CAMYuEzb5ezjrm3qnZkfe6NKGBEi5nuKT51E=yHvvm6ARS4vyOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,


I am developing a pathology image analysis tool using ITK and Qt. In
my program, I tried to use Bio-Formats to load big svs/TIFF images. I
have successfully used itkSCIFIO and loaded a 20M image and did some
image processing. But when I tried to load big images larger than 2
Gigs, I have to use streaming to avoid memory allocation error. But
the problem is, the image loading time is so long! It takes almost 10
minutes to load a 2 Gigs svs image! Is this normal? Does anyone known
how to solve this problem? Could you please give me some suggestion on
it? Thank you so much!

Hi Yu,

I would suggest trying to load your image in Fiji via the Bio-Formats
Importer plugin:

  http://fiji.sc/Bio-Formats

And see whether the load time is equivalent, or much faster.

If the load time is similar, then it is a limitation of Bio-Formats. In
that case, you can file an issue with the Bio-Formats team:

  http://openmicroscopy.org/info/bio-formats/about/bug-reporting.html

If the load time is much faster, then the problem is with the SCIFIO
ImageIO plugin. In that case, there is already an entry in the issue
tracker for this problem:

  https://github.com/scifio/scifio-imageio/issues/17

Feel free to comment on the issue if you want to be notified of progress.

Regards,
Curtis

Actually, it looks like the issue above is regarding memory performance.
You might want to file a new issue regarding time performance, if your
research confirms that the culprit is the SCIFIO ImageIO component.

Message-ID: <35D1E2F5-AA86-4FDC-8580-B9217C574671@dsuk.biz>

(Resending this now that I have joined the mailing list)

T1dSavingImagePlanes saves a fake image ?8bit-signed&pixelType=int8&lengths=50,50,3,5,7&axes=X,Y,Z,Channel,Time.fake? as a png file.

I run the program and it completes without errors.

I?m curious though because I didn?t think PNG files could handle anything other than 2D images. So I try to open the SCIFIOTutorial.png
in ImageJ and I see only a single plane image. There are no warnings or errors when saving the file to suggest that there is any loss of fidelity. Is
that the intention?

Anyway, I know TIFF files can support multiple channels, so I change SCIFIOTutorial.png to SCIFIOTutorial.tif and run the program. I get the following exception:

Exception in thread "main" io.scif.FormatException: Buffer too small (got 2500, expected 12500).
	at io.scif.util.FormatTools.checkBufferSize(FormatTools.java:665)
	at io.scif.util.FormatTools.checkPlaneForWriting(FormatTools.java:610)
	at io.scif.AbstractWriter.checkParams(AbstractWriter.java:121)

	at io.scif.AbstractWriter.savePlane(AbstractWriter.java:159)
	at io.scif.tutorials.core.T1dSavingImagePlanes.main(T1dSavingImagePlanes.java:75)

Now this is most unexpected, because I would have assumed the TIFF format was able to store the images with at least the same fidelity as PNG.

OK I know TIFF can save files of 3 dimensions, so I change the fake images to ?8bit-signed&pixelType=int8&lengths=50,50,7&axes=X,Y,Channel.fake?

Again I get and exception.

OK, how about a 2D image, ?8bit-signed&pixelType=int8&lengths=50,50&axes=X,Y.fake??

And that finally works.

So how do I save a X,Y,Channels image in TIFF format with SCIFIO?

Thanks for any help.

Hi Michael,

SCIFIO writes the APNG format [1] when there are multiple planes.

Standard PNG readers (including ImageJ 1.x's built-in PNG reader) will read
only the first plane. Did you try with File > Import > Image... which uses
SCIFIO when opening?

Thanks for the report. I can confirm this bug. I filed an issue for it:
    https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/236

> So how do I save a X,Y,Channels image in TIFF format with SCIFIO?

Once that issue is resolved, things should work!

Curtis, many thanks.

Whilst I?m on the subject of TIFF I experimented with using the TIFF specific reader/parser.

Our TIFF files use the PAGE_NAME TIFF TIFF tag to give a name to each of the channel names. Is this information accessible through the SCIFIO?

Many thanks ? Michael Ellis

Hi Stephan!

>a CellImg that is paged and can be read and written. Is this project
already finished, does this work already?

It is done! The SCIFIOCellImg
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/dc06e67c8a60ac3e93784722a3dc64d534f24834/src/main/java/io/scif/img/cell/SCIFIOCellImg.java>was
added a few hackathons ago with the guidance of Tobias. There are
heuristics to use it automatically as needed by the ImgOpener
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/dc06e67c8a60ac3e93784722a3dc64d534f24834/src/main/java/io/scif/img/ImgOpener.java>,
and you can also configure it
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/dc06e67c8a60ac3e93784722a3dc64d534f24834/src/main/java/io/scif/config/SCIFIOConfig.java#L364>
to be used by default.

If you're interested, there are tickets open to evaluate performance
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/201>, and supporting large planes
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/125> via SCIFIOCellImg is a goal
of mine for the next hackathon.

>Thanks so much and have a great day,

You too! Let me know if you have any questions/problems.

Best,
Mark

Message-ID: <CAMYuEzb5ezjrm3qnZkfe6NKGBEi5nuKT51E=yHvvm6ARS4vyOQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi folks,


I am developing a pathology image analysis tool using ITK and Qt. In
my program, I tried to use Bio-Formats to load big svs/TIFF images. I
have successfully used itkSCIFIO and loaded a 20M image and did some
image processing. But when I tried to load big images larger than 2
Gigs, I have to use streaming to avoid memory allocation error. But
the problem is, the image loading time is so long! It takes almost 10
minutes to load a 2 Gigs svs image! Is this normal? Does anyone known
how to solve this problem? Could you please give me some suggestion on
it? Thank you so much!

Hi Yu,

I would suggest trying to load your image in Fiji via the Bio-Formats
Importer plugin:

  http://fiji.sc/Bio-Formats

And see whether the load time is equivalent, or much faster.

If the load time is similar, then it is a limitation of Bio-Formats. In
that case, you can file an issue with the Bio-Formats team:

  http://openmicroscopy.org/info/bio-formats/about/bug-reporting.html

If the load time is much faster, then the problem is with the SCIFIO
ImageIO plugin. In that case, there is already an entry in the issue
tracker for this problem:

  https://github.com/scifio/scifio-imageio/issues/17

Feel free to comment on the issue if you want to be notified of progress.

Regards,
Curtis

Actually, it looks like the issue above is regarding memory performance.
You might want to file a new issue regarding time performance, if your
research confirms that the culprit is the SCIFIO ImageIO component.

Thanks,

I have successfully used itkSCIFIO and loaded a 20M image and did some image processing. But when I tried to load big images larger than 2 Gigs, I have to use streaming to avoid memory allocation error. But the problem is, the image loading time is so long! It takes almost 10 minutes to load a 2 Gigs svs image! Is this normal? Does anyone known how to solve this problem? Could you please give me some suggestion on it? Thank you so much!
