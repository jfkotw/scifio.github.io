Subject: [SCIFIO] spacing lost
Message-ID: <CAKSZWGy4BmU0GfMGWC407Ny9xf2jGwjK2KSD+pjt+QPHb0Ed+Q@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I have a .tif image with z-stacks of three channels (cropped version
attached).

With Fiji I can see that the spacing is set correctly:
Voxel size: 0.0616x0.0616x0.1998 micron^3

If I do:
./SCIFIOTestDriver itkSCIFIOImageIOTest /home/mmeuli/Bioimage/ITK/1-1.tif
/home/mmeuli/Bioimage/ITK/test.ome.tiff -w -a -d 5

The spacing in test.ome.tiff is lost:
Voxel size: 1x1x1 cm^3

If I set the spacing with itk::ChangeInformationImageFilter the spacing is
nicely set in itk but not written correctly to .ome.tiff or .tiff ...
I've compiled ITK on 29th June with an up to date master-branch.

No validation errors found:
mmeuli at mmeuli:~/Bioimage/Bio-Formats 5.1.2/bftools$ ./tiffcomment

Very glad to hear it is useful!

I mentioned the ITK bridge as an example of how to interface Bio-Formats
and/or SCIFIO with native C++ code. But I did not intend to imply that it
would meet your use case "out of the box." It uses pipes and is
surprisingly fast, and the code is not too complex, so it serves as a nice
example of how to integrate Java with non-Java using pipes.

You have a few different options here for how to improve the code to suit
your needs:

1) Fork scifio-itk-bridge and scifio-imageio, then hack them to match your
use case.

2) Generalize scifio-itk-bridge so that the C++ side has more control over
the "info" command [1]. This could be as simple as adding a new command
e.g. "info-verbose" that includes more metadata fields. It would do no harm
to add this to the Java side, even if ITK doesn't use it, if it makes the
Java library usable for you without further modifications.

If you opt for option 2, you are warmly welcome to submit a PR on GitHub
[2] containing the changes you need. And if you require technical
assistance with any details, we are happy to help.

Adding support for delivering that information across the pipe would be
very easy on the Java side, since Bio-Formats certainly knows which TIFF
files belong to the dataset.

However, the next issue then becomes how you are consuming that information
the C++ side. It sounds like your software is actually using ITK. Simplest
then might be to simply add more key/value pairs to the dictionary which is
passed across the pipe and stored in the ITK image [3]. If we do that, then
you would require zero changes on the C++ side?only additions on the Java
side as discussed above. And then your own C++ code would extract the
values of interest from the ITK object's dictionary.

But if you are only using ITK because that's what scifio-imageio provides,
you may want to consider crafting your own C++ "client" which communicates
with the scifio-itk-bridge "server" in its own way, for maximum flexibility.

I have CCed the SCIFIO mailing list, which includes Mark Hiner, the primary
author and maintainer of the SCIFIO ITK bridge components. Perhaps he will
have additional thoughts and suggestions that I missed.

Curtis

Hi Christian,

> best option for us soon.

Just for completeness, the other most common integration options are:

1) Native Bio-Formats C++ library.
https://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5.1/developers/cpp/overview.html
This can read and write OME-TIFF, but is complex to build.

2) Bio-Formats C++ bindings.
http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5.0/developers/c-bindings.html
This wraps the Java code with a C++ library exposing the entire Java API as
C++.
This would require you to ship a JVM (or ask user to install one).
It may also no longer be supported with BF5.1+; I am not sure.

If you opt to go for either of the above options over the ITK bindings,
then the best place to write for help is the ome-devel list, since those
tools are maintained by the OME team.

The main problem right now is the header information of OME TIFF files that is stored in:

<OME:TiffData IFD="0" FirstZ="0" FirstT="0" FirstC="0" />

This information does not seem to be transmitted through the bridge using the ?ReadImageInformation? function, and we are relying solely on the file names to sort the order of slices, channels and time steps. I think this is okay at the moment for the z information, but can certainly cause issues when using 4D or 5D images and a none standard file naming scheme. Thus, we would prefer access to the above header information. In addition, we typically try to import all relevant header information into Amira and try to add as much information to the data object in Amira as possible. We typically do this in form of parameter bundles that are stored in the header of the Amira Mesh file. This will give access to all information about the file to Amira users.

Teddy and Nicolas mentioned to me that the 8 or 9 functions in the ITK bridge only provide access to the information that Teddy listed in his email. We were wondering if you know of any trick that could give us access to all the header information through the ITK bridge, e.g. a pointer to the headers of all TIFF files in a data set. Do you think that the ITK bridge is capable of this, or do you have a different suggestion?

I would greatly appreciate your input on this.

Many Thanks,

Christian

Hi,

I am one of the developer of Amira and I am following Christian message to let you know that I am currently working on interfacing Amira with SCIFIO using the ITK4 bridge that you mentioned when you visited us.
I am using the itk 4.7.2 bridge in order to read OME-TIFF file format and I am probably doing something wrong.
You can probably help me.

Currently, using the ITK bridge, I can get some file information with the SCIFIOImageIO::ReadImageInformation().
I join an example image to this message.
On the example image, I get only:
Interleaved
0
LittleEndian
1
PixelType
3
SizeX
1344
SizeY
1024
SizeZ
1
SizeT
1
SizeC
1
RGBChannelCount
1
PixelsPhysicalSizeX
1.027921E-4
PixelsPhysicalSizeY
1.027921E-4
PixelsPhysicalSizeZ
1.244898E-4
PixelsPhysicalSizeT
1.0
PixelsPhysicalSizeC
1.0
UseLUT
False
Which is clearly not the complete header of the file (which is also attached to the email).

Do you have any clue on how to get the other information of the header?
Thanks in advance,

Teddy

It uses pipes and is surprisingly fast, and the code is not too complex, so it serves as a nice example of how to integrate Java with non-Java using pipes.

This could be as simple as adding a new command e.g. "info-verbose" that includes more metadata fields. It would do no harm to add this to the Java side, even if ITK doesn't use it, if it makes the Java library usable for you without further modifications.

Simplest then might be to simply add more key/value pairs to the dictionary which is passed across the pipe and stored in the ITK image [3]. If we do that, then you would require zero changes on the C&#43;&#43; side?only additions on the Java side as discussed above. And then your own C&#43;&#43; code would extract the values of interest from the ITK object's dictionary.
