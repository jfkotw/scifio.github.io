<PRE>Dear List,

First of all thanks for developing scifio and doing that open source. I 
have started to use it with ImageJ, since Fiji now offers the option to 
use it. Having said that, I may also have stumbled upon an issue. I'm 
unsure when (or whether) scifio releases the corresponding memory after 
images are closed. To look at this in a somewhat systematic way, I ran a 
macro (see below) to repeatedly open and close a 3GB single file 
uncompressed TIFF stack (2048x2048x367x16bits) and record some 
performance stats along the way. I ran this using a new download of Fiji.

Here are the results with scifio disabled:
      11450 ms to open files
   28578184 mem before opening files
9282667288 mem after opening files
9272732560 mem after opening files &amp; GC
9272780080 mem after closing files
   24220936 mem after closing files &amp; GC

And here with scifio enabled:
       43715 ms to open files
    26765224 mem before opening files
10517954400 mem after opening files
  9327459480 mem after opening files &amp; GC
  9327506440 mem after closing files
  9314822896 mem after closing files &amp; GC

I have also checked, whether memory is freed a couple of minutes after 
closing the images, which does not appear to be the case.

Note that scifio is also somewhat slower, although I'm a bit hesitant to 
bring this up, because it is still relatively young and I can see a few 
&quot;improve ... performance&quot; tickets in the issue tracker.

Below is the macro.
Kind regards,
Burkhard


nOpenTimes = 3;
file = &quot;/path/to/stack&quot;;

run(&quot;Collect Garbage&quot;);
memBefore = IJ.currentMemory();

msToOpen = getTime();
for (i=0; i&lt;nOpenTimes; i+=1) {
	open(file);
}
msToOpen = getTime() - msToOpen;

memFilesOpen = IJ.currentMemory();
run(&quot;Collect Garbage&quot;);
memFilesOpenGC = IJ.currentMemory();

for (i=0; i&lt;nOpenTimes; i+=1) {
	close();
}
memFilesClosed = IJ.currentMemory();
run(&quot;Collect Garbage&quot;);
memFilesClosedGC = IJ.currentMemory();

print(&quot;&quot;+ msToOpen + &quot; ms to open files&quot;);
print(&quot;&quot;+ memBefore + &quot; mem before opening files&quot;);
print(&quot;&quot;+ memFilesOpen + &quot; mem after opening files&quot;);
print(&quot;&quot;+ memFilesOpenGC + &quot; mem after opening files &amp; GC&quot;);
print(&quot;&quot;+ memFilesClosed + &quot; mem after closing files&quot;);
print(&quot;&quot;+ memFilesClosedGC + &quot; mem after closing files &amp; GC&quot;);
