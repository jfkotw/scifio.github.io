Hi everyone,

Recently, we held a vote to determine whether the imagej-devel and
fiji-devel mailing lists should be closed in favor of the new ImageJ Forum
[1], and it was decided that they should be [2].

Afterward, it occurred to me that this SCIFIO list is even more "special
purpose" than the imagej-devel list was, and covers a subset of development
topics. (This was not always true historically, but these days, the SCIFIO
API is fully built on the ImageJ2 data model.)

As such, we are also closing this list in favor of the ImageJ Forum. If you
make a forum post about SCIFIO, just mark it with the scifio tag!

See you on the forum!

Regards,
Curtis
