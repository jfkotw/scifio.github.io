Hi Curtis and Mark,

Has the Imaris writer been adde to FIJI yet? Where should I look to find

Best,
Henry

Hi Henry,

Yes, it was added on February 3.

> Where should I look to find it--in the save as menu?

No one added an ImageJ command for it, so it will not be in the menus. (We
learned that having a separate menu item for every file format does not
scale well.)

Rather, the writer will be invoked automatically by the File > Export >
Image... command when a file with extension .ims is specified.

Unfortunately, in my tests just now, there are bugs. I filed some issues
for them:

* https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/261
* https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/262

We will investigate these problems later this week.

Regards,
Curtis

For anyone who's interested, these issues are now fixed on master branches
and can be tested by enabling the SCIFIO-dev update site[1,2]

Thanks!
