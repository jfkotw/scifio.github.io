Subject: [SCIFIO] Open Micro-Manager dataset in Fiji using SCIFIO
Message-ID: <3E848941-8DF4-43BF-8D8A-8224B09A1877@normalesup.org>

Hello,

In line with earlier posts on ome-users mailing list [1], I?m trying to find a convenient way to open large Micro-Manager stacks in Fiji (in particular, such stacks are split in several 4.2gb tif files because MM doesn?t handle bigtiff). My problem so far has been that Bio-formats is parsing all positions in a dataset even when opening a single one. Mark Tsuchida (MM?s developer) suggested that using SCIFIO might be a workaround [2].

I tried the following:
- File > Import > SCIFIO
This raises an exception and open an error dialog? You might want to fix this, unless it?s a fiji specific issue?
- File > Open after selecting ?Use SCIFIO? in Options > ImageJ2
This successfully opens the file but it?s slower than the File > Import > BioFormats! Moreover it parses metadata for all positions in the dataset (even when they are saved to different files). I can?t understand this behaviour since there is no way to choose to open all related positions? In my opinion the appropriate behaviour would be: if the MM dataset is saved with all positions in the same stack (i.e. no ?_Posxx.ome.tif? in the file name; possibly split in several .tif files) then open each position in a separate window, if the MM dataset is saved with positions in separate files (i.e. ?_Posxx.ome.tif? found in the file name; again possibly split in several .tif files if a given position is larger than 4.2gb) then **parse only** and open only the selected position? This would really speed things up for stacks acquired in datasets with many positions (of a few large ones).

I hope that this makes sense and that the issue can be addressed.
Thanks for your help. Best,

Thomas

Hi all,

For those interested, Curtis and I spent the last week of July in Janelia
for hackathon, at the kind invitation of Stephan Saalfeld and Philipp
Keller.

There was significant impact on the future direction of SCIFIO development
(planar generalization and better integration with ImgLib2) and plugin
testing throughout the ImageJ ecosystem (a "melting pot" test to identify
conflicts between components in complex systems.. i.e. Fiji).

A full summary is available, as always, on the wiki:

Hi Thomas,

Thanks for the report. I filed an issue in the SCIFIO issue tracker with
these details:

https://github.com/scifio/scifio/issues/279

Things are crazy busy until the ImageJ conference this September, but we
will try to respond more thoroughly later this fall.

In the meantime, in case you didn't already know, the relevant source code
is here:
https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/scifio-0.24.0/src/main/java/io/scif/formats/MicromanagerFormat.java

Be warned that SCIFIO is undergoing a substantial refactoring at the
moment, to move away from plane-centric API toward a block-based one.

Regards,
Curtis

Dear Curtis,

thanks for your answer.
In fact, I?m not sure whether it?s more a scifio issue or a fiji one. My point is that in the fiji interface, open parses all positions although it opens a single file. 

Does scifio aim at handling entire datasets? then I understands that it has the ability to parse entire datasets, but the way it?s called by fiji could probably be significantly more efficient. or at least open a bioformat-like dialog offering to open all positions.
If scifio is designed with single images, then its code could probably be stripped down to parse metadata more efficiently?

Best,
Thomas
