Subject: [SCIFIO]  SCIFIO or Bio-Formats for C++?

Hi,

I wanted to add Nikon Elements nd formats support to a program written in
C++, and I think integrating SCIFIO or Bio-Formats into the program do the
job.

After Google searching for a while, I am still very confused and not sure
which one to use.
Bio-Fomrats C++
<http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5.1/developers/cpp/overview.html>
seems
to be a newer method and the most native to C++ , but on the page it says
it only supports TIFF and OME-TIFF and all other readers and writers from
the Java implementation are currently unavailable.
Bio-Formats C++ bindings
<http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5.1/developers/jace/overview.html>
has
been there for a long time. Maybe this is still the way to go?
SCIFIO-imageio <https://github.com/scifio/scifio-imageio> is the only
SCIFIO project related to C++ that I could find, but it was written for ITK.

Are these the options that I have now for my need?

Thanks,
Joe

Hi Joe,

This article[1] has good links to discussions on this topic (and Java/C++
interoperability in general).

> Bio-Formats C++

Your observations are right on - this is the only option that avoids
C++/Java cross-talk, but would require implementation of the Bio-Formats
reader(s) you're interested in.

> Bio-Formats C++ Bindings

Since these are C++ wrappers that call into Java code, this is likely the
easiest/fastest way to get immediate C++ support for all of Bio-Formats.

> SCIFIO-imageio

This is an unfortunate victim of early SCIFIO brand/library conflation:
it's not actually SCIFIO-based right now, but uses Bio-Formats (C++/Java
communication is accomplished via pipes, instead of the C++ bindings).
Since it's ITK-based I don't think it will meet your needs.

There will likely eventually be a C++ SCIFIO (or ImageJ) core that will
give you all the Bio-Formats format support, but for now I would recommend
trying out the C++ Bindings. If the ND2 reader is added to Bio-Formats C++
then that may be a good fit for your application.

Hope that helps.

Best,
Mark
