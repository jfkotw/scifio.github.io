Hi Michael,

I opened a pull request <http://review.source.kitware.com/#/c/16967/> to
get the latest SCIFIO-ITK imageIO incorporated into the master ITK branch.

This fixes the metadata bug suspected by Roger (the dimensions of the first
series were always being used, which would crash on encountering a dataset
with smaller dimensions). It also upgrades the ImageIO to use Bio-Formats
5.0.4, and has some other minor fixes and improvements.

With these updates I was able to fully convert your image as a multi-series
image, using the command:
SCIFIOTestDriver ko-A.ome.tiff out.ome.tif -w -a -d 5

Thanks for the report, it was very helpful. Please let us know if you run
into any more problems.

Regards,
Mark

Hi Jerome,

 It's great to hear your interest in integrating your format with SCIFIO
and ImageJ2. I'm copying this mail to the SCIFIO mailing list, as this
would be of interest and benefit to the community.

>I hope you could add this the the SCIFIO or explain me where to integrate
this modification.

 There is a SCIFIO component, SCIFIO-tutorials
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio-tutorials>, which was designed to
introduce the API to developers. In particular, the Custom Format
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio-tutorials/blob/master/core/src/main/java/io/scif/tutorials/core/T3aCustomFormats.java>
tutorial and studying a simple existing format
<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/master/src/main/java/io/scif/formats/PCXFormat.java>
would be the recommended starting point. If anything is unclear in these
tutorials or if you have further questions about how the SCIFIO format
should be structured, please feel welcome to ask questions on this list,
and to report issues on GitHub.

 Once you have a SCIFIO reader for your format, you can distribute it to
users via an update site
<http://imagej.net/How_to_set_up_and_populate_an_update_site>.

 With a little work <https://github.com/scifio/scifio-bf-compat/issues/4>
on my part, your new SCIFIO reader will get picked up by Bio-Formats, which
will then allow it to work in Stitching.

 We're happy to provide any guidance we can - looking forward to your
contributions and feedback!

Regards,
Mark
