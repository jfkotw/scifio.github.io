Message-ID: <CAPYmBX2U8NmCa6MMVh1vMO3fPG=LhPYCoODLprnqs3NF0XeSLQ@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

   I 'git pull' the latest ITK code and switch to v4.5.1 by 'git checkout
tags/v4.5.1'. In CMake (advanced mode) I don't see an option of
'Module_SCIFIO' or 'Fetch_SCIFIO' like the page says (
http://www.openmicroscopy.org/site/support/bio-formats5/users/itk/). How do
I make ITK to download SCIFIO?

Thanks,
Joe

Unfortunately those instructions are correct (although it is called
"Module_SCIFIO" now, and not "Fetch_SCIFIO" on 4.5.1).

What operating system are you using?

I am assuming you just did something like (from the top-level of the ITK
checkout):
* mkdir build
* cd build
* ccmake ..

to start the CMake configuration.. does that sound about right? That works
for me locally right now.

Thanks,
Mark

SCIFIO shows up if I git clone a brand new copy of ITK and checkout the tag
'v4.5.1' from that, but it won't show up if I git pull my old copy (on
master) and checkout the tag from there. Guess I'll just clone a new copy
every time. I am on Windows BTW. Upgrading from an old copy on Mac works
fine though.

Thanks,
Joe

I'm glad you found a workaround, but that sounds like odd behavior.
Forwarding this to the Insight-Users list.. does anyone know why this might
happen?

Thanks for the info!

Subject: [SCIFIO] 0.11.0 Released
Message-ID: <CA+B=mGrLPRqBLBamL5ZNhsR+YYWa6gm0=ptFBvuC_yWFbAHCkA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

 Just a quick note that I released a new
SCIFIO<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/releases/tag/scifio-0.11.0>today.

This was a pretty small release, but had two big changes that we wanted to
get out:
- automatic BigTiff<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/commit/f7683eb5fc490b150318a8963105e8e54be4c15e>output
detection. When saving datasets over 2GB we will now automatically
write BigTiff, removing the need to set this flag manually.
- ImgOpener can now open more than one
image<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/commit/b1a32a555ddfba37852ac1aa0224206a795c191d>in
a dataset. There is API for opening specified indices, ranges or the
complete dataset. This should help simplify logic in consuming code (e.g.
no more loops to open all the ImgPluses).

Thanks!
- Mark

Right. My apologies that that problem has continued to exist for so long.
IMO, Bio-Formats should auto-detect whether the output file might be large
enough to be need BigTIFF, and act accordingly. But the current 5.0.1
release does not.

Actually, that SO question is about a different issue: huge planes. The
BigTIFF format is actually needed even for more modest size planes, when
you simply have many of them, which result in a TIFF file of more than 4GB
in size. Regular TIFF uses 32-bit offsets, so as soon as the TIFF file gets
over 4GB, there is no way to indicate that an offset should go deeper into
the file than that. BigTIFF solves this problem by using 64-bit offsets.

Well, there is also an API method in TiffWriter: setBigTiff(true). But of
course you have to write a little program in order to use it; there is no
built-in method in the ImageJ user interface to enable that option. And it
is off by default.

I am not sure why you are seeing those errors. I would need to know more
about how you were trying to build the system. The best ways to build
Bio-Formats are with either Ant ("ant jars" from top level works) or Maven
(e.g., "mvn" from top level).

> What am I missing and/or is there any simple way to solve this problem

Earlier today, Mark Hiner released a new version of SCIFIO that
automatically enables BigTIFF as needed:
    http://scif.io/pipermail/scifio/2014-April/000067.html
    http://maven.imagej.net/content/groups/public/io/scif/scifio/0.11.0/

We are close to having Fiji use SCIFIO for its image I/O by default; once
that happens, opening and saving large images should "just work" even when
they are larger than 4GB in size.

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Adam,

> I'll try out the new SCIFIO and let you know what happens.

Great! Just to be clear: SCIFIO is not used by default in Fiji... yet.
Coming soon. In the meantime, you can either:

Try with ImageJ2 (experimental!):
- Help > Switch to Modern Mode
- File > Save As...

Write a program which uses SCIFIO's ImgSaver API:
-
https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/scifio-0.11.0/scifio/src/main/java/io/scif/img/ImgSaver.java

Unfortunately there isn't a great tutorial yet for me to point you at --
this stuff is still a bit bleeding edge. But we're happy to answer any
questions you have if you reply back to the list!

Regards,
Curtis

Unfortunately those instructions are correct (although it is called
"Module_SCIFIO" now, and not "Fetch_SCIFIO" on 4.5.1).

What operating system are you using?

I am assuming you just did something like (from the top-level of the ITK
checkout):
* mkdir build
* cd build
* ccmake ..

to start the CMake configuration.. does that sound about right? That works
for me locally right now.

Thanks,
Mark

SCIFIO shows up if I git clone a brand new copy of ITK and checkout the tag
'v4.5.1' from that, but it won't show up if I git pull my old copy (on
master) and checkout the tag from there. Guess I'll just clone a new copy
every time. I am on Windows BTW. Upgrading from an old copy on Mac works
fine though.

Thanks,
Joe

I'm glad you found a workaround, but that sounds like odd behavior.
Forwarding this to the Insight-Users list.. does anyone know why this might
happen?

Thanks for the info!

Subject: [SCIFIO] 0.11.0 Released
Message-ID: <CA+B=mGrLPRqBLBamL5ZNhsR+YYWa6gm0=ptFBvuC_yWFbAHCkA@mail.gmail.com>

Hi all,

 Just a quick note that I released a new
SCIFIO<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/releases/tag/scifio-0.11.0>today.

This was a pretty small release, but had two big changes that we wanted to
get out:
- automatic BigTiff<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/commit/f7683eb5fc490b150318a8963105e8e54be4c15e>output
detection. When saving datasets over 2GB we will now automatically
write BigTiff, removing the need to set this flag manually.
- ImgOpener can now open more than one
image<https://github.com/scifio/scifio/commit/b1a32a555ddfba37852ac1aa0224206a795c191d>in
a dataset. There is API for opening specified indices, ranges or the
complete dataset. This should help simplify logic in consuming code (e.g.
no more loops to open all the ImgPluses).

Thanks!
- Mark

Hi Adam,

Right. My apologies that that problem has continued to exist for so long.
IMO, Bio-Formats should auto-detect whether the output file might be large
enough to be need BigTIFF, and act accordingly. But the current 5.0.1
release does not.

Actually, that SO question is about a different issue: huge planes. The
BigTIFF format is actually needed even for more modest size planes, when
you simply have many of them, which result in a TIFF file of more than 4GB
in size. Regular TIFF uses 32-bit offsets, so as soon as the TIFF file gets
over 4GB, there is no way to indicate that an offset should go deeper into
the file than that. BigTIFF solves this problem by using 64-bit offsets.

Well, there is also an API method in TiffWriter: setBigTiff(true). But of
course you have to write a little program in order to use it; there is no
built-in method in the ImageJ user interface to enable that option. And it
is off by default.

I am not sure why you are seeing those errors. I would need to know more
about how you were trying to build the system. The best ways to build
Bio-Formats are with either Ant ("ant jars" from top level works) or Maven
(e.g., "mvn" from top level).

Earlier today, Mark Hiner released a new version of SCIFIO that
automatically enables BigTIFF as needed:
    http://scif.io/pipermail/scifio/2014-April/000067.html
    http://maven.imagej.net/content/groups/public/io/scif/scifio/0.11.0/

We are close to having Fiji use SCIFIO for its image I/O by default; once
that happens, opening and saving large images should "just work" even when
they are larger than 4GB in size.

Regards,
Curtis

Hi Adam,

> I'll try out the new SCIFIO and let you know what happens.

Great! Just to be clear: SCIFIO is not used by default in Fiji... yet.
Coming soon. In the meantime, you can either:

Try with ImageJ2 (experimental!):
- Help > Switch to Modern Mode
- File > Save As...

Write a program which uses SCIFIO's ImgSaver API:
-
https://github.com/scifio/scifio/blob/scifio-0.11.0/scifio/src/main/java/io/scif/img/ImgSaver.java

Unfortunately there isn't a great tutorial yet for me to point you at --
this stuff is still a bit bleeding edge. But we're happy to answer any
questions you have if you reply back to the list!

Regards,
Curtis
