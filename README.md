# The [SCIFIO Website](https://scif.io)

This is the repository for the [SCIFIO website](https://scif.io). It's a simple front-facing website that lists basic information about SCIFIO and directs users to more information if they need it. In addition, it has a few useful image resources for users, and an archive of previous outgoing mail messages. It is built with [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com), [jQuery](http://jquery.com/), [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com), and a few other open-source web libraries.

Like SCIFIO itself, this website is built by the SCIFIO community, and is continuously improved by contributors all around the world. With that in mind, all forks and PRs are welcome!

## Development Setup

Setting up the website and developing on it is quite simple - all any developer needs is terminal access and a text editor!

First, clone (and fork, if needed) the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/fiji/fiji.github.io.git
$ cd fiji.github.io
```

Then, just visit `index.html` with your web browser!
